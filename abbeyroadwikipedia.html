	<h2><i>Abbey Road</i></h2>
	<h5><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></h5>
	
	

	<a name="Background"></a> <p><i><strong>Abbey Road</strong></i> is the eleventh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album" target="_blank">album</a> by English <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music" target="_blank">rock</a> band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles" target="_blank">the Beatles</a>, released on 26 September 1969 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records" target="_blank">Apple Records</a>. The recording sessions for the album were the last in which all four Beatles participated. Although Let It Be was the final album that the Beatles completed before the band's dissolution in April 1970, most of the album had been recorded before the Abbey Road sessions began.[1] A double A-side single from the album, "Something"/"Come Together", released in October, topped the Billboard chart in the US.</p>


	<i>Abbey Road</i> is a rock album that incorporates genres such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues" target="_blank">blues</a>, pop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music" target="_blank">pop</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock" target="_blanket">progressive rock</a>,[3] and it makes prominent use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer" target="_blank">Moog synthasizer</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_speaker" target="_blank">Leslie speaker</a>. Side two contains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_medleys">medley</a> of song fragments edited together to form a single piece. The album was recorded amid a more enjoyable atmosphere than the Get Back/Let It Be sessions earlier in the year, but there were still frequent disagreements within the band, particularly over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney" target="_blank">Paul McCartney's</a> song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Silver_Hammer" target="_blank">"Maxwell's Silver Hammer"</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon" target="_blank">John Lennon</a> had privately left the group by the time the album was released and McCartney publicly quit the following year.


	<p>Although <i>Abbey Road</i> was an immediate commercial success and reached  No.  1 in the UK and US, it initially received mixed reviews, some critics describing its music as inauthentic and bemoaning the production's artificial effects. Many critics now view the album as the Beatles' best and rank it as one of the greatest albums of all time. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison" target="_blank">George Harrison's</a> contributions, "Something" and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_the_Sun" target="_blank">"Here Comes the Sun"</a> are considered to be among the best songs he wrote for the group. The album's cover, which features the four band members walking across a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_crossing" target="_blank">zebra crossing</a> outside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios" target="_blank">Abbey Road Studios</a>, has become one of the most famous and imitated images in the history of popular music.</p>

<h1>Composition and Recording<h1>

	<h2><strong>Side One</strong></h2>

	<h3><strong>"Come Together"</strong></h3>

	<p>"Come Together" was an expansion of "Let's Get It Together", a song Lennon originally wrote for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary" target="_blank">Timothy Leary's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California" target="_blank">California gubernatorial campaign</a> against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan</a>. A rough version of the lyrics for "Come Together" was written at Lennon's and Ono's second bed-in event in Montreal.

	<p>Beatles author Jonathan Gould suggested that the song has only a single "pariah-like protagonist" and Lennon was "painting another sardonic self-portrait".[25] MacDonald has suggested that the "juju eyeballs" has been claimed to refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._John" target="_blank">Dr John</a> and "spinal cracker" to Ono.[26] The song was later the subject of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Together#Lawsuit" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a> brought against Lennon by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Levy" target="_blank">Morris Levy</a> because the opening line in "Come Together" – "Here come old flat-top" – was admittedly lifted from a line in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry" target="_blank">Chuck Berry's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%27t_Catch_Me" target="_blank">You Can't Catch Me"</a>. A settlement was reached in 1973 whereby Lennon promised to record three songs from Levy's publishing catalogue for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_(John_Lennon_album)" target="_blank">next album.</a></p>
	
	<p>"Come Together" was later released as a double A-side single with "Something". In the liner notes to the compilation album Love, Martin described the track as "a simple song but it stands out because of the sheer brilliance of the performers" </p>

	<h3><strong>"Something"</strong></h3>

	<p>Harrison was inspired to write "Something" during sessions for the White Album by listening to label-mate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Taylor" target="_blank">James Taylor's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_in_the_Way_She_Moves" target="_blank">"Something in the Way She Moves"</a> from his album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Taylor_(album)" target="_blank"><i>James Taylor</i></a>. After the lyrics were refined during the <i>Let It Be</i> sessions (tapes reveal Lennon giving Harrison some songwriting advice during its composition), the song was initially given to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cocker" target="_blank">Joe Cocker</a>, but was subsequently recorded for Abbey Road. Cocker's version appeared on his album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cocker!" target="_blank">Joe Cocker!</a> that November.</p>

	<p>"Something" was Lennon's favourite song on the album, and McCartney considered it the best song Harrison had written. Though the song was written by Harrison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" target="_blank">Frank Sinatra</a> once commented that it was his favourite Lennon–McCartney composition and "the greatest love song ever written". Lennon contributed piano to the recording and while most of the part was removed, traces of it remain in the final cut, notably on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-two-bar_form#Middle_eight" target="_blank">middle eight</a>, prior to Harrison's guitar solo.</p>

	<p>The song was issued as a double A-side single with "Come Together" in October 1969 and topped the US charts for one week, becoming the first Beatles number-one single that was not a Lennon–McCartney composition; it was also the first Beatles single from an already released album. Apple's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Aspinall" target="_blank">Neil Aspinall</a> filmed a promotional video, which combined separate footage of the Beatles and their wives.</p>

	<h2><strong>Side Two</strong></h2>

	<h3><strong>"Here Comes The Sun"</strong></h3>

	<p>"Here Comes the Sun" was written by Harrison in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton" target="_blank">Eric Clapton's</a> garden in Surrey while Harrison took a break from stressful band business meetings. The basic track was recorded on 7 July 1969. Harrison sang lead and played acoustic guitar, McCartney provided backing vocals and played bass and Starr played the drums. Lennon was still recuperating from his car accident and did not perform on the track. Martin provided an orchestral arrangement in collaboration with Harrison, who overdubbed a Moog synthesizer part on 19 August, immediately before the final mix.</p>

    <p>Though not released as a single, the song attracted attention and critical praise. It has been featured several times on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4" target="_blank">BBC Radio 4's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Island_Discs" target="_blank">Desert Island Discs</a>, having been chosen by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandie_Shaw" target="_blank">Sandie Shaw</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Springer" target="_blank">Jerry Springer,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson" target="_blank">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Paige" target="_blank">Elaine Paige</a>.The Daily Telegraph's Martin Chilton said it was "almost impossible not to sing along to". Since digital downloads have become eligible to chart, it reached number 56 in 2010 after the Beatles' back catalogue was released on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.</p>

    <p>Harrison recorded a guitar solo for this track that did not appear in the final mix. It was rediscovered in 2012, and footage of Martin and Harrison's son <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhani_Harrison" target="_blank">Dhani</a> listening to it in the studio was released on the DVD of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World" target="_blank">Living in the Material World.</a></p>

    <h3><strong>"Because"</strong></h3>

    <p>"Because" was inspired by Lennon listening to Ono playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" target="_blank">Ludwig van Beethoven's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._14_(Beethoven)" target="_blank">Moonlight Sonata"</a> on the piano. He recalled he was "lying on the sofa in our house, listening to Yoko play ... Suddenly, I said, 'Can you play those chords backward?' She did, and I wrote 'Because' around them."[57] The track features three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, which were then triple-tracked to give nine voices in the final mix. The group considered the vocals to be some of the hardest and most complex they attempted. Harrison played the Moog synthesizer, and Martin played the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpsichord" target="_blank">harpsichord</a> that opens the track.</p>

    <h1>Production</h1>

    <p>Abbey Road was recorded on professional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording" target="_blank">eight-track</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel-to-reel_audio_tape_recording" target="_blank">reel to reel</a> tape machines rather than the four-track machines that were used for earlier Beatles albums such as <i>Sgt Pepper</i>, and was the first Beatles album not to be issued in mono. The album makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer, and the guitar played through a Leslie speaker. The Moog is not merely as a background effect but sometimes playing a central role, as in "Because" where it is used for the middle eight. It is also prominent on "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" (played using a ribbon strip) and "Here Comes the Sun". The instrument was introduced to the band by Harrison who acquired one in November 1968 and subsequently used it to create his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Sound" target="_blank">Electronic Sound</a> album. Starr made more prominent use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom-tom_drum" target="_blank">tom-toms</a> on Abbey Road, later saying the album was "tom-tom madness ... I went nuts on the toms."</p>

	<p>Abbey Road was also the first and only Beatles album to be entirely recorded through a solid state <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor" target="_blank">transistor</a> mixing desk, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI_TG12345" target="_blank">TG12345 Mk I</a>, as opposed to earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube" target="_blank">thermionic valve</a> based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI_REDD" target="_blank">REDD desks</a>. The TG console also allowed better support for eight-track multitrack recording, helping the Beatles' considerable use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdubbing" target="_blank">overdubbing</a>. Emerick recalls the TG desk used to record the album had individual limiters and compressors on each audio channel and noted the overall sound was "softer" than the earlier valve desks.</p>

	<p>One of the assistant engineers working on the album was a 19-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Parsons" target="_blank">Alan Parsons</a>. He went on to engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd" target="_blank">Pink Floyd's</a> landmark album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon" target="_blank">The Dark Side of the Moon</a> and produce many popular albums himself with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alan_Parsons_Project" target="_blank">Alan Parsons Project</a>. Kurlander also assisted on many of the sessions, and went on to become a successful engineer and producer, most noteworthy for his success on the scores for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_series" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings</a> film trilogy.</p>

	<h1>Album Cover</h1>

	<p>The cover was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records" target="_blank">Apple Records</a> creative director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kosh" target="_blank">Kosh</a>. It is the only original UK Beatles album sleeve to show neither the artist name nor the album title on its front cover, which was Kosh's idea, despite EMI claiming the record would not sell without this information. He later explained that "we didn't need to write the band's name on the cover ... They were the most famous band in the world."</p>
